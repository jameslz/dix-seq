# Dix-seq: An integrated pipeline for fast amplicon data analysis


## Abstract

The amplicon derived from 16S rRNA genes, 18S rRNA genes, internal transcribed spacer sequences or other functional genes can be used to infer and evaluate microbial diversity or functional gene diversity. With the development of sequencing technologies, large amounts of amplicon data were generated. Several different software or pipelines had been developed for amplicon data analyses. However, most current software/pipelines require multistep and advanced programming skills. Moreover, they are often complex and time-consuming. Here, we introduced an integrated pipeline named Dix-seq for high-throughput amplicon sequence data processing. Dix-seq integrates several different amplicon analysis algorithms and software for diversity analyses of multiple samples. Dix-seq analyzes amplicon sequences efficiently, and exports abundant visual results automatically with only one command in Linux environment. In summary, Dix-seq enables the common/advanced users to generate amplicon analysis results easily and offers a versatile and convenient tool for researchers.
